<p class="indent">I am currently enrolled in the Geographic Information Systems – Cartographic Specialist Program at Sir Sandford Fleming College, School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences in Lindsay Ontario. I am also a recent graduate of the Ecosystem Mangagement Technician Program at Fleming College. In that program I gained experience working on ecological monitoring projects, assessing vegetation cover, the soil type and observing wildlife within a study site. In 2021, i also graduated from Brock University, receiving a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Biology. In my fourth year at Brock, I designed and implemented my honours thesis project which allowed me to develop the ability to identify a wide variety of flora common to Ontario. Additionally, this project enhanced my oral and written communication skills and provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the field. I have also used multiple computer software systems to organize and analyze data collected from these projects, including Microsoft Excel, ArcGIS Pro, and  R Studio. </p>

<p class="indent">While working at Kawartha Conservation, I gained experieve working independently on projects where I designed watershed and ELC maps with ArcGIS Pro software. I was also involved in surveying dams, bridges, and culverts within the Kawartha and Trent Lakes Municipalities for floodplan mapping. Additionally, while working as a field assistant at 8Trees Inc, I participated in the monitoring, capturing, measuring, and releasing of amphibians and reptiles; specifically, species at risk such as the Massasauga rattlesnake and Fowler’s toad. In addition, I learned how to effectively utilize field guides and identification keys, strengthening my ability to identify the common flora and fauna of Ontario. As well, I have worked at Fleming College’s (Frost Campus) Arboretum and Hatchery. While at the hatchery I have enhanced my knowledge of fish anatomy, diseases, behaviours, and care. Through these experiences, I have gained strong leadership, communication, and time management skills.</p>
